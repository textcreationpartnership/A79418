            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Charme for Canterburian Spirits.</head>
            <p>WHo is there amongſt us, that hath not been ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, or at leaſt affrighted at the ſtrange appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and horrid Appearances of theſe Malignant and <hi>Canterburian</hi> Spirits, who like <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> or <hi>Will</hi> with a <hi>Wiſp,</hi> have led ſo many out of the right way, into the intricate La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borinths of Malignancy and folly; and ſo have begot a Viperous brood of <hi>Hydra</hi>-headed Cavaliers, whoſe yeeſty braines are in continuall motion, and work higher, as they are filling their bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe and ſwiniſh carcaſes With Stigian Liquors, whilſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves become the ſhame of themſelves, being odious to God, hatefull to Man, burdenſome to Nature, and the root of much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and diſturbance to this poor afflicted, and languiſhing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; the eye of reaſon and underſtanding ſeeing them variouſly diſguiſed, or Metamorphoſed into Beaſts of divers qualities and conditions.</p>
            <p>The firſt appeares like a Lyon (though a ravening one) and ſwares ſo faſt, as if he had no more words then oathes, hee makes great brags of the Rapine and miſchief he hath committed on the Roundheads in divers Counties, which hee moſt impudently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth to the greatneſſe of his Valour, and haughtineſſe of his courage, his greateſt diſcourſe is of Swords, Rapiers, Daggers, Piſtolls and Carbines, which are the proper Inſtruments belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his trade, which is cutting of Throats; and then raps you out ſome Twenty Oaths, and then begins to ſware, That Canterbury died a Martyr, and deſerved to be ſainted, and will trace him in all the circumſtances of his Sermon, till he comes to the <hi>Red ſea,</hi> his braines ſwiming in a ſea of Ale, which hee manfully diſgorgeth with his Sermon, where we will leave him dead drunk.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is metamarphoſed into a <hi>Fox,</hi> this is a crafty ſlye companion, and lies all upon the Catch, but will not prey neere
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:159430:3"/>home, but fartheſt from his den, leaſt he ſhould be diſcovered; he craftily preys upon the ſimple, and tells them, <hi>That to take up Armes againſt the King, is to fight againſt God,</hi> which wee inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly confeſſe, yet will nevertheleſſe, as long as breath remaines in our noſtrills, protect our King, and fight againſt, and Earth ſuch crafty <hi>Foxes,</hi> that by their Cunning ſlie inſinuations, and pernitious Counſells, have miſlead ſo good a King, and almoſt undone ſo flouriſhing a Kingdome.</p>
            <p>The third doth appeare like a Calfe, but indeed a <hi>Cavee.</hi> He can maintain the Miter to be above Crowne, the Croſier ſtaffe above the Scepter, and the Cope and Surpleſſe to be of greater Antiquity then the Parliament Roabe, and can for a need, raiſe Controverſies to little edifying, Chop-Logick and Philoſiphie, which he uſes as the ſubtilties of Sathan, to deceive the ſimple, to which little-purpoſe, he relates unto you many profane humane ſtories, which reliſh more of his owne vaine Oſtentation, then of the Spirit. This Beaſt will tell us of Imperiouſneſſe againſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, both Spirituall and Temperall, becauſe wee renounce and defie all obedience to evill and Malignant Calves like himſelf, blind Biſhops and their Antichriſtian vaſſalls, which were not long agoe in ſo faire a way to bring us under their ſlaviſh ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and cruell tyranny. Hee tells us, No <hi>Pilate,</hi> no <hi>Prince,</hi> tells of <hi>Zealous Ignorance,</hi> calls us Hypocrites, having all Zeal, and no Knowledge, all Purity, and no Humanity, all Simplicity, and no Honeſty, when indeed they are all his own proper Epethites and bear greater rule in him, then himſelf over his Punck or Tobacco-pipe; this Calf is a great bleater in our Streets of <hi>London,</hi> and if let alone, will at laſt become a bellowing bull of <hi>Baſan;</hi> but I, hope the Magiſtracy of this City, will take order for the bayting of this Malignant beaſt, whoſe malice like <hi>Phalaris</hi> Bull, makes that a torment firſt for himſelf, which hee hath invented to puniſh o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>The Fourth, as fierce as a <hi>Gooſe,</hi> and is alwayes biſsing againſt the Parliament, and becauſe one of his breed preſerved the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Capitall, he conceives he ſhould ſit in all great Aſſemblies,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:159430:3"/>and nothing paſſe them without his Ganderſhips approbation, if any thing pleaſe him not, he is preſently in ſuch Choller, that hee ſputters again, which drives him preſently to his proper Lake the Ale-houſe, which hee ſo loves and honours, that he doth reverence it with a nod or cringe as he enters the doore. His Religion is moſt commonly his pretence of diſcontent, though he can be of all Religions, but truly of none; where hee findes no cauſe to tax the State, he deſcends to rayl againſt the Rates of Commodities, bitterly curſing the Exciſe upon his Ale and Tobacco.</p>
            <p>The fifth, is a Goatiſh Cavaliere, borne in <hi>VVorceſterſhire,</hi> and had his firſt bringing up upon <hi>Mauburne</hi> hills, which he takes for ſo great an honour, that he ſtands upon tip-toes, and brags much of his Gentility. Being a man of high feeding, hee is commonly il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litterate, debauched and lacivious, and is oft given to quarrell at the innocencie and ſimplicitie of the ſheep, becauſe they want the garb of a compleat Gallant, which he takes himſelf to bee; But the Great Sheepheard hath decided the quarrell which is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter man, and hath put him on the left hand. Hee is very quick of hearing, but not ſo quick, as to hear any good of himſelf, though every one cries out on him, Fie how he ſtinks, which hee neither regards, nor beleeves, by reaſon of his pride and ſelf-conceitednes, becauſe hee beleeveth hee hath gained a place in the heavens, though hee have lived never ſo ill a life on earth; hee was prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for his good parts to Biſhop <hi>Wren,</hi> and by him put into a Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carridge, with this <hi>proviſo,</hi> that he ſhould drive all the Puritanes (as hee termed them) out of his Pariſh, and thanked God, <hi>That he had never a Lecturer left in his Dioceſſe,</hi> and ſo received from him his Inſtructions. To preach <hi>Altar VVorſhip, Forgiveneſs</hi> of <hi>ſins by the Prieſt,</hi> Holy dayes to be obſerved before, or equall with the Lords Day, That the Prelates <hi>had as much Power (without the King) to govern in Eccleſiaſticall matters, as the King had in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, without the Biſhops, and to refuſe to deliver the Sacrament to ſuch as would not come up to their Railes, and to excommunicate others for hearing Sermons in other Parriſhes, though they had none in their own for a moneth together, calling it Spirituall Whoredome.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:159430:4"/>
            <p>And is grown to that height of Impiety, that he compares the King to the man that went from Jeruſalem to Ierico, and fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thieves, that wounded him of his Honor, Robbed him of his Caſtles, and the hearts of his Subjects, the Prieſt paſsing by, was the Proteſtant, the forward Profeſſor the Levite; But the Papiſt was the good Samaritane (eſpecially the Iriſh Papiſt) and that the Subject, with all he had, were at the Kings Command, and many ſuch, and worſe Doctrines of Devills, were frequently preached, which ſpread like an infectious Leprofie over the body of the whole Kingdom, and were ſupported with the two Arches of Pride, and Luſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> and <hi>Wren,</hi> that made their five ſenſes the Cinqe ports to traffick, with their Captain <hi>Sathan,</hi> for the ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let coloured Whore; though for it they were forc'd to pay the the Coſtome-tribute with their ſoules.</p>
            <p>The ſixt is the Aſſe Cavaliere, that like an eaſie patient Beaſt, bears burthens, or Arms againſt himſelf, and fights againſt his own Liberty, till he enſlaves himſelf to Tyranny and Opreſsion; of theſe Beaſts there are not a few that <hi>Bray</hi> up and down this City, yea, few houſes but are haunted with one or more of theſe Spirits, which never diſcover themſelves ſo farre, as when they ſit on their Ale-benches in Tipling-houſes, where they commonly meet together; the profuſeneſſe and beaſtly ſenſuality of thoſe houſes it were fit were taken into conſideration, as well for ſuppreſsing the great number of them, as for the redreſsing the manifold A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes committed in them, to the great diſhonour of God, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of his good Creatures, and the utter undoing and impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of moſt that frequent them. And how odious a fight is it in the eye of a Chriſtian, to ſee an Ale-houſe and a Brothel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, with painted Impudence, prepoſterouſly bugger one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>another, and ſo begit the baſtard iſſue of a Tobacco ſhop, which they breed up between them both, who receives ſuch inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from his evill Parents that in a ſhort time hee out vapours them both in wickedneſſe: How many poor Mechanicks have ſplit themſelves on theſe fatall Rocks, and ſo conſequently ſunke themſelves and families in the vaſt Ocean of Poverty and miſery?
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:159430:4"/>How many Murders, Adulteries, Thefts, &amp;c. take their originall from that crying ſinne of drunkenneſſe? And how needfull it were that there might be but a ſet number, which might be ſtock'd by the pariſhes in which they are, and honeſt men deputed for the keeping thereof, and the gaines ariſing therefrom to helpe to feed the poor, that hath occaſioned ſo much poverty, as to prevent the abuſes before mentioned, I leave to their conſideration, that have already ſuppreſſed two inſeperable companions to theſe houſes, <hi>viz.</hi> the Swearer, and Profaner of the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>The ſixt and laſt, is the <hi>Apo</hi> Cavaliere, which is a right Mimick, made naturally to play the Ape for his owne ends: How many Moncky'ſh Prieſts did Ape that Arch-ape of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in crin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and bowing to Crucifixes, Altars, and in wearing Copes and Surplices, ſome of which were not much inferior to Mr. <hi>Jacks</hi> Coat, who in the Deſert was content with that garb and coat that nature had beſtowed upon him, but being brought to the City, he muſt be cloath'd as occaſion ſerves? How many of our Prieſts at firſt, were coutented with a Cloak or Caſſack, but once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Rome,</hi> they <hi>muſt doe as</hi> Rome <hi>do's,</hi> and ſo Ape one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till they become perfect Apes themſelues? How did our Canterburyans lately ape one another in their Altar-worſhip, Preaching, Titles, Poſtures, Habits and the like, dancing even meaſures to <hi>Canterburies</hi> muſick, though at laſt, like fooliſh apes, they broke all his ſtrings, delighting to heare them crack aſunder? How did they ape one another in perſecuting Godly Miniſters, Excommunicating, ſuſpending, baniſhing, impriſoning, cutting off eares, ſearring faces, ſlitting Noſes, and the like, as if they would ſcale heaven by murder, or (as <hi>Cant, Serm. ult.</hi> obſerveth) wade to happineſſe through a red ſea of blood; being not only cruell Perſecuters and Tyrants, but great Poluters of the ſervice of God with ſuperſtitious inventions, and tricks of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing, forcing conformitie to their iniquitie, impiety, cruelty, craft, hypocriſie and deep diſsimulation.</p>

               <q rend="italic">MIghty Monarch, and Powerfull Potentate of all the Infernall habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; though I am little inferior to thy ſelf (thy terrible Titles only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) in Devilliſh Pollicy, yet I have held it my duty, to give the Devill his due. Therefore conſider (Mighty Prince) by what means thy Royall Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer hath been enlarged, and thy ſelf become ſo great, thy Court ſo glorious, and thy Dominions ſo populous; Or whether any of this numerous Traine have brought more ſouls to thy ſubjection then my ſelf? or have laboured more hard to make the people underſtand, that they ought to underſtand nothing, and ſo led them by the Noſes to the Obedience of <hi>Rome,</hi> that there might be Room made for them in hell? Have I not ſet Civill Wars afoot in England? Have I not ſtood ſtiffly for my King, and went forward to the loſſe of my life, to maintain an unlawfull and unlimmited Prerogative, to the danger of my Countreys ruine? Have not I cry'd up Superſtition and Formallity? I beſeech your Deviſhip conſider, Can there be in your Infernall apprehenſion (my life and converſation conſidered) any reaſon, but that (next your Majeſtie) I ſhould bear rule in theſe your Infernall Dominions</q>
               <p>The Devill fearing the great Pollicie of this Arch-Prelate, though loath, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcended thereto, cauſing <hi>Antonio Daemonibus</hi> his Secritary, ſpeedily to draw up a Decree to that purpoſe, and charged all his Inſtruments of Horror, to give him the ſame Reverence due to himſelf, and the beſt entertainment hell could aford.</p>
